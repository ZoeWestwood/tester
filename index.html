						<p>Hi! I'm Zoe, I am 23 years old and a web designer living in Fleet, Hampshire. I have always had an interest in techology and IT whilst being in school but it wasn't until collage where I found I had a passion for designing and making websites. From there I went to study Web Design and Development at Southampton Solent University achieving a 2:1 with honours.</p>
						
						<p>I am currently working as a Junior Web Designer at <span class="nowrap">CV-Library</span> within this role I carry out regular website updates, ensuring code is up to date and following our inhouse design system. I also design and code products including emails, bespoke company profiles and job adverts for our clients. </p>
					
						<p>Within my spare time I volunteer as a Guide Leader for 3rd Crookham Guides. I enjoy keeping fit by going to the gym, binge watching Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. I also throughly enjoy cross stitching and in the future I would like to start desiging my own patterns to sell on Etsy.</p>

					  <p>A junior role within the CV-Library online design team this role is split between designing and coding products to client specifications, carrying out regular maintenance on the CV-Library website and admin pages.</p>

						<p>As part of my role, I use a range of programs within the Adobe package including illustrator, XD and Photoshop where I have learnt to manipulate images, compose new images and create informative gifs. Within Adobe  XD create mock-ups of bespoke profiles, premium job templates and adverts – these are designed using any specifications the client may have and are approved before going onto the live website. Other products that I often create and code are internal and external emails.</p>

						<p>Updating and carrying out essential maintenance to the CV-Library website is also a large task within my role, this includes updating internal admin pages ensuring all floorplans across all office space and meet the team page are accurate and fully filled out. Recently the website has had a width increase and a number of pages had to be expanded to suit the new layout of the website, I updated a number of pages editing pre-existing code and updating it to follow new guidelines and making the pages fully responsive and therefore accessible on all devices. </p>

I worked systematically from multiple lists to verify numerous accounts in order to meet and excel daily targets. This was recorded using a number of Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets to keep track of productivity. I regularly made outbound phones calls to inform and talk suppliers through their profile updates. I would also support the helpdesk by taking incoming calls and dealing with customer queries or transferring the caller to the appropriate department within the office.</p>
